This repository contains supporting code for "[The impact of inconsistent ethnicity recordings on estimates of inequality in child health and education data: A data linkage study of Child and Adolescent Mental Health services in South London.](https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-078788)" 

It contains a Stata Do file for cleaning and comparing ethnicity data in Clinical Record Interactive Search ([CRIS](https://www.maudsleybrc.nihr.ac.uk/facilities/clinical-record-interactive-search-cris/)) versus the National Pupil Database ([NPD](https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/national-pupil-database)).

The code was was developed by  [Alice Wickersham](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/alice-wickersham) , who was a NIHR Maudsley Biomedical Research Centre PhD Student at King's College London at the time of conducting the study. This represents independent research funded by the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and King's College London (NIHR-INF-0690).
